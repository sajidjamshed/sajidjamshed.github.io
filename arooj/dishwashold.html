      <!-- <h3>The Magic Drop - Dish Wash...<br><br>   -->
      <h3> Dish Wash liquid (washing-up liquid in British English) also is a detergent used to assist in dishwashing. It is usually a highly foaming mixture of surfactants and is primarily used for hand/ machine washing of glasses, plates, cutlery, and cooking utensils in a sink or bowl. In addition to its primary use, dishwashing liquid also has various informal applications, such as for creating bubbles, baby clothes washing and cleaning oil-affected birds.
Dishwashing liquid is used primarily for removing food from used dishes and tableware. Heavy soil (large food particles) is generally scraped from the dishes before using. Detergent formula can vary based on use (hand or automatic). A solution of dishwashing liquid and water may be used to remove coffee, tea, olive oil, soda and fruit juice stains from fabrics. Magic Drop dishwash has been used to remove stains from white or lightly-colored cloth & napkins. Some other usaes of dishwashing liquid are:</h3><br>
      <h3> <span style="color: #d4793a"> Cleaning outdoor furniture: </span> A dishwashing liquid functions well on countertops, window sills and other types of surfaces like glass and plastic.
Add a small bit of the liquid to a spray bottle filled with warm water, to cleanse away the dirt and grime. Next, wipe over the soapy surface with a well-wrung cloth and allow the surface to dry naturally. This concentrate works very well on outdoor furniture that has been exposed to outdoor dirt and dust. </h3><br>
     <h3> <span style="color: #d4793a"> Degreasing kitchen appliances: </span> Appliances such as ovens, toasters, blenders, refrigerators and griddles in the kitchen require regular cleaning, as they are subject to the build-up of sticky grease and stains from cooking. Stainless steel cleaners can be very expensive so using a gentle dishwashing liquid mixed with warm water will polish off stains, fingerprints, and marks leaving your stainless steel appliances sparkling.</h3><br>
     <h3> <span style="color: #d4793a"> An effective stain buster: </span> Oil-based stains are the hardest to remove, often leaving behind a dark stain or cause discolouration even after soaking. However, dishwashing liquid remove grease may work even better than conventional laundry detergents. In fact, dishwashing liquid is especially effective at removing food-based oils, making it a great spot treatment for stained table cloths or couch fabrics. Dishwashing liquid also tends to be gentle enough on delicate fabrics like silk and wool, which could be easily damaged by laundry detergent due to its more potent chemical composition. The method to go about this is to dissolve around 1 tablespoon of the dishwashing liquid into 2-3 cups of warm water, and carefully dab on the stain with a clean cloth dipped into the mixture. Repeat this until the stain starts to disappear.</h3><br>
     <h3> <span style="color: #d4793a"> Polishing jewellery back to its original shine: </span> Our jewellery collects dirt with frequent wearing, resulting in dull or cloudy looking accessories. For an easy at-home way to polish jewellery and get it back to its original shine, mix a tiny portion of dishwashing liquid with water and soak the jewellery for 5-10 minutes. If necessary, use a toothbrush to scrub out any stubborn stains. </h3><br>
